MANIFEST

In connection with the emergence in society of a clear disproportionate distribution of resources, fiat and other capitals based on formed political, religious, economic strata (manipulation technologies) I consider it appropriate to test a political technology based on the possibility of providing legislative powers to each of the participants of this *system (hereinafter referred to as the System)

The system is a political technology based on blockchain technology designed to test the following theories:

about the non-violent replacement of goverments by redirecting financial flows (public management of the distribution of the budget and tax collection, the introduction of a tax on unused capital, the introduction of a progressive scale of tax on profits, incomes)

about increasing the individual responsibility of the participants in the system on the basis of social contracts (legislative initiative) through an accessible educational program about the System and the current political and religious, information manipulation technologies.

possibilities of unification of criminal, tax, civil law of various countries

the possibility of abandoning borders and states

opportunities for collective management of entrepreneurial activities, organizations with the participation of the budget of the System

on the possibility for each participant of the System to perform the following roles:

legislative

law enforcement

judicial (appointment of an executor in the presence of the required number of votes at the moment, termination of powers in case of loss of a majority of votes within a certain time, the possibility of reviewing decisions made), the possibility of using a jury trial from among the System participants

the possibility of increasing the level of sovereignty of the members of the System on the basis of military training, the military duty of each member of the System, the obligation to store and use hunting, firearms, if necessary.

Technical implementation:

1 system member = 1 private key = 1 mining node, authorization in the first version is centralized, by selfie with a passport mining of system blocks is carried out by each participant of the system, otherwise it loses the ability to vote, at the same time, each participant in the mining receives a reward, the results of calculating the hash of the next block are checked for each participant in the system, in case of an incorrect result or a long counting time, the participant loses the right to vote and does not receive remuneration

when registering, it is necessary to answer a number of questions (votes) that determine the interface of interaction with the system (created by the genesis participant), for example: -age restriction of system participants -selection of the language of the System (eng) -vote for transaction tax -Voting for the allocation of the budget -voting to merge repetitive bills ....

3.Disclaimer upon registration:

the law or proposal is accepted by all members of the community with 50% + 1 voting (TODO: the ability to vote for a change of % is more than 50)
4.Client part in the form of a desktop application for the MVP version

5.Classic implementation of cryptocurrency transactions

Currently implemented:

-Classic PoW blockchain version in Golang

Voting - transactions according to the logic of likes - 1 vote per offer from 1 participant ? cancellation of votes upon termination of mining mapping uuid of the offer - address of the participant

Invitation of beginners already participating by referral? Limitation, for example, 4 people in the number of blocks, responsibility for the quality of knowledge of those invited
